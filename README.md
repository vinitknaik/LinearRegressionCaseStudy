## Problem Statement
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

The company wants to know:
* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* How well those variables describe the bike demands
  
Business Goal:
to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Analysis Approach
- Data sourcing (Upgrad given loan.csv file)
- After data sourcing apply EDA concept and perform the required changes/cleanup on the received data.
- Then apply actual Data Analysis and Data Visualization concepts using Linear Regression, which will helps to understand the trends.
